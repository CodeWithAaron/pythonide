# What is an IDE?
An integrated development environment is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. 
An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger.
Some IDEs, such as NetBeans and Eclipse, contain the necessary compiler, interpreter, or both; others, such as SharpDevelop and Lazarus, do not.
