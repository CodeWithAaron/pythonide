# Create your own IDE using python

With this code, it generates an IDE which you can edit! You can change the name, logo etc. Please bear in mind that it may not be completed, or it may have a few buggy patches.

# What is an IDE?
An integrated development environment is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. 
An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger.
Some IDEs, such as NetBeans and Eclipse, contain the necessary compiler, interpreter, or both; others, such as SharpDevelop and Lazarus, do not.
